# Recipe Discovery App

## About The Project

The Recipe Discovery App is an innovative solution designed to make cooking and recipe discovery a breeze. Built with Streamlit, Gemini-pro, and Gemini-pro-vision, this app offers a user-friendly interface and powerful functionality to transform the way users interact with recipes. The app is divided into three main pages:

1. **Home Page**: Users can input ingredients they have on hand, and the app suggests recipes that utilize those ingredients.
2. **Recipe to Ingredients**: Allows users to enter the name of a recipe and receive a list of required ingredients along with step-by-step cooking instructions.
3. **Photo to Recipe**: Users can upload a photo of ingredients or a dish, and the app will identify it and provide the recipe name, ingredients, and cooking instructions.

Additionally, the app features custom CSS styling for an enhanced user experience.
